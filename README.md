📌 Project Title:
Animated Smart Village (OpenGL 3D Simulation)

🧠 Description:
A 3D animated simulation of a smart village built using OpenGL. The project showcases a visually dynamic environment with a realistic day-night cycle, animated sun and clouds, flying aircraft, streetlights that turn on/off automatically, solar panels, trees, houses, wind turbines, and roads with dynamic lighting and fog effects. Designed to highlight modern graphics techniques and environmental interactivity in real-time.

⚙️ Technologies Used:

C++

OpenGL

GLUT (for windowing and input handling)

GLU (for advanced primitives)

🧪 Key Features:

Dynamic day and night transition with lighting and fog adjustments

Animated sun with emission blending for realistic sunlight

Smart street lighting system (auto light on/off based on time)

Solar panels with reflective glass material and steel frame

Realistic house models with lighting-responsive windows

Windmill with rotating blades

Flying aircraft that orbits the village

Animated clouds with soft movement

Road system with dashed yellow center lines

Forest of procedural trees

Modular and reusable 3D models (tree, house, sun, etc.)

🎯 What I Learned:

Advanced OpenGL rendering pipeline and material systems

Dynamic lighting, fog, and emission blending

Scene graph structuring for complex animated environments

Simulating real-world systems (solar panels, wind turbines)

Modular design and use of reusable functions for graphics projects
